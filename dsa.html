            Learning data structures and algorithms trains you to think
            systematically and solve problems efficiently. They shape how you
            approach challenges, turning brute force into structured logic. Most
            companies test these skills to gauge not just coding ability, but
            clarity of thought and problem-solving depth.

          <p class="dsa-box-para">
            <b>• Pick one programming language:</b> You don’t need to master every
            corner of it. Start with easy problems to grasp syntax and the real
            use of each structure. <br />
            <b>• Use curated lists like <a
              href="https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=blind75"
              class="leetlink"
              target="_blank"
              ><i>Blind-75</i></a> or <a
              href="https://neetcode.io/practice?tab=neetcode150"
              class="leetlink"
              target="_blank"
              ><i>NeetCode-150</i>:</a></b> watch
            solutions if needed, but revisit until you can explain every line.
            <br />
            <b>• Gradually drop the “training wheels”:</b> tackle mediums and
            sprinkle in hard ones to stretch your skills. <br />
            <b>• Always analyze time and space complexities:</b> they’re as
            important as the code itself.

            Gather resources from their site or online discussions, then
            practice targeted problems. Tailor your prep so you’re solving the
            kinds of challenges they will actually ask.

          <h2 class="dsa-head">Consistency Matters</h2>
          <p class="dsa-box-para">
            <b>Consistency beats intensity: </b>
            Progress compounds with steady practice. Solve a little every day,
            review mistakes, and keep refining. Over time, small habits lead to
            big breakthroughs.

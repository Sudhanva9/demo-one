          <h2 class="dsa-head">Inspiration</h2>
          <p class="dsa-box-para">
            My journey into UI/UX & web development began during my undergraduate years. What excited me most was how every piece of code I wrote transformed instantly into something tangible & interactive. That direct feedback loop, seeing & experiencing my work, pulled me deeper into design and development, even outside my formal coursework.

          <h2 class="dsa-head">Crafting Web</h2>
          <p class="dsa-box-para">
            For me, building web applications is more than just putting elements on a screen; it’s about creating fluid, meaningful interactions. From structuring responsive layouts to refining typography and accessibility, I aim to craft experiences that feel natural and intuitive across devices.

          <h2 class="dsa-head">The Tech</h2>
          <p class="dsa-box-para">
            Exploring technologies like SASS & React has shaped how I approach projects. With SASS, styling became modular & scalable, while React introduced a powerful component-driven mindset, helping me build applications that are not just functional, but also maintainable & extendable.

          <h2 class="dsa-head">Pushing Boundaries</h2>
          <p class="dsa-box-para">
            The most mind-blowing aspect for me has been realizing how far the web has evolved—what once needed native apps can now run entirely in the browser. Leveraging APIs, animations, and performance optimizations, I’ve been able to experiment with features that merge creativity and engineering, making projects feel alive.
